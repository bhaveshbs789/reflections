What happens when you initialize a empty repo ? Why do you think that needs to be done ?
When we initialize a empty repo a .git file is created and it means we are ready to add tracking to our files.

How can you use the staging area to make sure that you have one commit per logical change ?
Ans. We use git diff to check the changes between the working and the staging area
